# Creature Controller

This is the Linux implementation of my creature controller!

There's two parts to it, the `controller` that runs on a Linux host (or macOS), and the `firmware` that runs on an RP2040.

The documentation isn't located here, it's on my website: [April's Creature Workshop](https://creature.engineering)

Head over there to see it!
