/**
 * @file emergency_stop_message.c
 * @brief Emergency stop message processor for animatronic controllers
 *
 * This module handles emergency stop (ESTOP) messages that immediately power down
 * all servo motors and place the system in a safe, non-recoverable state. The
 * emergency stop is designed to be triggered when dangerous conditions are detected
 * such as overheating, excessive power draw, or motor obstructions that require
 * human intervention. Only a power cycle can restore normal operation.
